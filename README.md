# Python 101

This repository is a record of my earliest adventures in Python. It contains exercises from Eric Grimson's *Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python*, and also a few ideas of my own to implement what I've learned.

## Making Change

A running theme in the early days has been making change! From coins1.py to coins5.py, I've gradually improved my program as I've learned more. I started off not even knowing floor division, let alone for loops; by coins5.py, I learned enough to make a simple and efficient program. Commented out at the bottom of coins5.py you can see my original attempts to display my results: I achieved the results I wanted by using range(len(coins)), but when I learned that this was unpythonic, I used the zip function to make a simpler display.

Each script opens with a comment summarising my progress in each version, and what I learned in order to make improvements.
